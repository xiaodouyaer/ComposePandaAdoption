## :scroll: Description
<!--- Describe your app in one or two sentences -->
This is a challenge app for adopting pandas written by Jetpack Compose.

The app contains an overview screen that displays a list of pandas, and a detail screen showing each panda's details.

## :bulb: Motivation and Context
<!--- Optionally point readers to interesting parts of your submission. -->
<!--- What are you especially proud of? -->
I use Jetpack Compose to implement the UI layer.I think the UI is beautiful.You can try.
尝试一下吧，感觉还是很不错的，不用再写XML界面了，就是可能需要花费一些时间去学习，不过我相信这对于我们这些搞程序的人来说都是小意思。
